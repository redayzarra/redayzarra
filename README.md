As a senior in college studying computer science and biomedical engineering, I have developed a strong foundation in both technical and analytical skills. In addition to my coursework, I have also gained valuable experience through my tech blog, where I regularly share my thoughts and insights on emerging technologies and their applications in machine learning, web development, and biomedical engineering.

I have consistently sought out opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge in real-world settings. For example, I have worked on many independent projects, including several machine learning-based analyses of real-world data as well as a business portfolio for my own advertising agency, and more.

In the future, I am eager to leverage my diverse skill set to make a positive impact in the field I choose to concentrate on. I am confident that my passion for technology and my dedication to continuous learning will make me a valuable asset to any team.
