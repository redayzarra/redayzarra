# About Me

I'm a software engineer at Amazon in Seattle. I'm currently building [StudyDSA.com](https://studydsa.com/), a free online resource for students to master data structures and algorithms. My portfolio features a range of open-source projects, from programming drones to training chess bots. I enjoy turning complex problems into beautiful simple solutions.
