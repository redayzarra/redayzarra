# About Me

I'm a full-stack developer and data scientist from Boston, MA. I'm currently building [StudyDSA.com](https://studydsa.com/), a free online resource for students to master data structures and algorithms. My portfolio features a range of open-source projects, from programming drones to training chess bots. I enjoy turning complex problems into beautiful simple solutions.
