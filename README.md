# About Me

I'm a full-stack developer and data scientist from Boston, MA, currently working on leveraging Python, TypeScript, and a host of other technologies to create dynamic, innovative solutions. My portfolio features a range of open-source projects, from web-based drone control systems to automated trading bots. I enjoy turning complex problems into beautiful simple solutions.

As I transition into the professional world, I am actively seeking internship and new graduate opportunities where I can apply my robust technical skills and passion for innovation. I am excited to join a team where I can continue to learn, contribute meaningfully, and drive the technological and biomedical frontiers forward
